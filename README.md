### Introduction
ChessCat is a console chess engine. You can also use ChessCat to play human vs. human chess. It stores all your games so that you can pause and come back later, or review past games. You can store additional information about your games such as the players and date. All games are stored in PGN format so that you can share them with friends or copy them to other chess programs. To view the path to where games are stored, enter `gamespath` as your move after you start a game. Enter `help` after the start of a game to view all commands. Enter your moves in [Algebraic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)).
